--------The information regarding the kinetic proofreading MATLAB codes-------
"accuracy_graph.m" gives the curve between error fraction (free energy disparity, log(f)) and driving rate constant (energy coupled at the driving step, log(m))
"error_correction_with_different_KX.m" is for the log(f) vs log(m) curves for different values of Kx
"symbolic_optimized_driving_rate.m" gives a symbolic value of the optimized driving rate constant
